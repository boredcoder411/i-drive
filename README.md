# display_crate
probably the ugliest program in the entire distribution, abandon all hope when cloning this repo

## Running
```sh
cargo run --release
```

## A few words
The c part was adapted from https://github.com/armlabs/ssd1306_linux
The rust bindings were generated with the bindgen cli, not crate (couldn't get it to work)
